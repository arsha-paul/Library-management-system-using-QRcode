# Library Management System using QR Codes

This project implements a library management system using PHP, HTML, and JavaScript, leveraging QR codes for efficient book tracking.  It allows librarians to manage books, members, and borrowing/returning processes, while members can easily access book information and their own borrowing history.

## Features

* **Book Management:**
    * Add new books with details like title, author, ISBN, and publication year.
    * Generate QR codes for each book for quick identification and tracking.
    * Search and browse books by various criteria (title, author, ISBN).
    * Update and delete book information.
* **Member Management:**
    * Register new members with personal details.
    * Assign unique member IDs.
    * Manage member profiles (update information, deactivate accounts).
    * Search and browse members.
* **Borrowing/Returning:**
    * Scan book QR codes to quickly record borrowing transactions.
    * Associate borrowing transactions with members.
    * Track due dates and manage overdue books.
    * Scan book QR codes to record return transactions.
* **QR Code Integration:**
    * Generate QR codes for each book, containing relevant book information.
    * Use a QR code scanner (either a dedicated scanner or a mobile app) to read QR codes for borrowing and returning.
* **Reporting & Analytics (Optional):**
    * Generate reports on book availability, popular books, overdue books, etc.
    * Visualize data with charts and graphs.
* **User Authentication:**
    * Secure login for librarians with different access levels.
    * Member login (optional) to view their borrowing history.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (potentially with a framework like jQuery or Bootstrap for enhanced UI).
* **Backend:** PHP (for server-side logic and database interaction).
* **Database:** MySQL or similar relational database (for storing book, member, and transaction data).
* **QR Code Generation:**  A PHP QR code library (e.g., `phpqrcode`).
* **QR Code Scanning:**  Can be done using a dedicated QR code scanner or a mobile device with a QR code scanning app.  If using a mobile device, you might consider integrating a JavaScript QR code scanning library for a web-based solution.
